			At Wheels 2 Go, we aim to make it easy for Wellingtonians to exercise and explore the outdoors, with the help of our ‘takeaway’ bikes and scooters. Our hope is to improve the well-being of the people in this city. <br><br>

			Whether you love the thrill of mountain biking or prefer the calmness of a ride along the waterfront,  we have the wheels for you. <br><br> 

			Right here on our website, you can choose from a mountain, electric, or road bike, or an electric or monster scooter, specify how long you want to hire it for and where you’d like to pick it up from. After you’ve paid, you’re given a code to unlock your selected scooter or bicycle. Once you’re done, simply return it back to the same bike rack you picked it up from. We also provide helmets for free! After all, safety is key.
